# Tapestry

## Introduction

This public repository contains information about the Project Tapestry prototype. It does not contain the source code for the app.

Note also that this is a **work-in-progress** and details are certain to change.

## Documentation

A JavaScript-based API is used by Tapestry to gather information from the public Internet.

[This document](Documentation/API.md) explains the variables, objects, actions, and functions that are available for JavaScript development. A section at the end explains how plug-ins are configured.

There is also a PDF with the [prototype architecture](Documentation/Architecture.pdf). Everything in dark blue is covered in the document above.

## Plugins

The [Plugins folder](Plugins) shows examples of plugins that were created for the prototype. Each plugin is listed using a reverse domain name identifier.

Each plug-in has a [configuration file](Plugins/org.joinmastodon/plugin-config.json) that provides metadata to the prototype. For example, if OAuth is needed to make requests.

There is also a [user interface configuration](Plugins/org.joinmastodon/ui-config.json) that specifies inputs for settings and variables for JavaScript code.

Finally, there is the JavaScript that implements the plug-in. The most complex example is the one used for [Mastodon](Plugins/org.joinmastodon/plugin.js) (138 lines). A simpler example checks the [USGS Earthquake Summary](Plugins/gov.usgs.earthquake/plugin.js) (41 lines).

We feel confident that this simple API can be used to handle any information on the public Internet. ([Even XML!](Plugins/xml.feed/plugin.js))

Ideally, these plug-ins should be user installable. For example, if you have custom built Raspberry Pi monitoring your garden's water tank, it could be added to Tapestry to give periodic updates in a timeline. The challenge to accomplish that goal is building a secure distribution system for plug-ins.

## Tapestry Loom

You can use the plug-ins above with our developer tool: [Tapestry Loom](https://files.iconfactory.net/software/beta/Tapestry-Loom.zip). Download the macOS app and copy the plug-ins above to the `plugins` folder (click the "Open Pluginsâ€¦" button to get there quickly). You can also add your own plug-ins to that folder and restart the app to test them out. 

## Screencast

For an in-depth look at what you can do with these files, take a moment to watch [Project Tapestry - Weaving An API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5C2_zwy8cQ) on YouTube. This 30 minute video will help you get set up, show some tip and tricks, and give you a demo of how they're used in an iOS app.

## Kickstarter

We are running a [Kickstarter](https://iconfactory.com/kickstarter) to fund a native iOS app based on this prototype. If the idea of a configurable and customizable Internet excites you, please [check it out](https://iconfactory.com/kickstarter)!
