The YouTube connector lets you keep an eye on your favorite channels: whenever a new video is posted, you'll see it in your feed.

The easiest way to add a channel is with the [Feed Finder](tapestry://feedfinder) â€” when you enter a value like `youtube.com/@MKBHD`, the feed will be set up automatically.
