This connector displays a feed of earthquakes from around the world. The feed is generated by the [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov).

The feed can be configured to show significant quakes or ones above a certain threshold on the Richter scale.

This is the first connector written for Tapestry and was written by Craig Hockenberry ([@chockenberry](https://mastodon.social/@chockenberry)) while creating the first prototype.
