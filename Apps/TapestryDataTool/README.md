# Tapestry Data Tool

This tool uses a Tapestry backup file that contains with feeds, connectors, and other configuration data and converts whatever it can to an OPML file.

The latest version of the Mac app can be [downloaded from our website](https://files.iconfactory.net/software/TapestryDataTool.zip).

The backup file format is JSON and this tool can also be used as an example of how to extract information. The app has no dependencies and should be easy to adapt and build for your own needs. You will need to set your own Team in Signing & Capabilities.
